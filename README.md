## Basic algorithms implelemented in x86 assembly language (__intel syntax__):
* Transfer elements from one array to another _(array\_transfer.asm)_.
* Find the minimum and the maximum of an array _(min\_max\_array.asm)_.
* Multiply two arrays element by element _(mul\_arrays.asm)_.
* Calculate the sum of all elements of two arrays _(sum\_arrays.asm)_.
* Invert an array using the srack _(invert\_array.asm)_.
* Count the number of items which are equal to 0 in an array using a procedure _(count\_zeros.asm)_.
* Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers using a procedure _(gcd.asm)_.
